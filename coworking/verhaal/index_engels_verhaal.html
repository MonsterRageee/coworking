                <p> Los Pollos Hermanos is a charming family business that has its origins in the heart of a small
                    village called Saltillo. This food paradise was founded by none other than Gus Fring, together with
                    his devoted brother, Max Arciniega. Together they call themselves the "Chicken Brothers," a name
                    that
                    has become synonymous with delicious culinary experiences and a warm, family atmosphere.</p>
